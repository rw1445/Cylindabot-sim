# Cylindabot-sim

This is the code and scene used simulating Cylindabot for academic experiments.

"Cylindabot: Transformable Wheg robot traversing stepped and sloped environments"
Rob Woolley, Jon Timmis and Andrew Tyrrell

Python designed to run through Coppeliasim API to make obstacles and control the robot. Used for slope and step for the paper but capable of doing other terrain too.
